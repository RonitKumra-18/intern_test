Nighwan technologies intern test



- Importing libraries such as pandas(for data exploration), matplotlib(graphs and visualization) and seaborn(Statistical graphs).
-Loading the supply chain dataset and inspecting the first 10 rows.
-Making a histogram(with kernel density estimate) to understand the spread of order quantities.
-Counting occurrences in 'Supplier name' column, ranking the top 5 with most orders.
-To get variation of order quantities with lead time, group by leadtime and take mean of order quantities. Then plot a line chart.
-To compare the product type with multiple metrics, group by product type, take sum of all four metrics, melt the dataset to plot easily. Then make a grouped bar plot.
-To get average lead time, simply take the mean of lead time column.
